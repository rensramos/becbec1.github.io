<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The PulseBand is a wearable heart health device designed to detect and warn users of life threatening episodes as well as give insight to their daily health data.</p>

<p>My team and I were tasked with designing the companion mobile app that will be used alongside the wearable band that assists users in understanding their data.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Using an agile approach we broke the project into three sprints.</p>

<h3>Sprint 1</h3>

<p>We set out to discover everything we could about heart disease, wearable medical devices, and what daily life is like for those living with a heart condition.  We conducted industry research, medical research, and interviews with SMEâ€™s as well as potential users.</p>

<p>Our research and interviews changed the scope and focus of the project. We  originally were focusing on helping people manage their heart disease. We found that there was a need for a product that would help prevent heart disease or significantly delay it.</p>

<h3>Design Principles</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Persuade users to make better choices</li>
	<li>Present data in an empathetic and understandable way</li>
	<li>Users need to feel empowered through manageable tasks</li>
	<li>The app should know what you need and proactively help you accomplish it</li>
	<li>Resources should be available, but not forced onto users</li>
</ol>

<p>We created user personas for the two most important user groups. Those who would use the PulseBand to monitor a current heart condition and those that were at risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack.</p>

<h3>Sprint 2</h3>

<p>We began designing with the focus of showing users the relationship between unhealthy habits and bad heart health to encourage changes in user behavior.</p>

<p>After numerous user scenarios, user flows, and app maps we produced our first set of wireframes.</p>

<h3>Sprint 3</h3>

<p>Analysis and heuristic analysis gave us enough improvements to create the second iteration of wireframes.</p>

<p>User testing revealed some big issues that had slipped through the cracks. We were not succeeding in presenting users with their data in an  understandable way. The design had a heavier cognitive load than we were intending.</p>
