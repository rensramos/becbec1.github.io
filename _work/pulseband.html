			<h2>Goals</h2>

			<p>The PulseBand is a wearable heart health device designed to detect and warn users of life threatening episodes as well as give insight to their daily health data.</p>

			<p>My team and I were tasked with designing the companion mobile app that will be used alongside the wearable band that assists users in understanding their data.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>

			<div class="greyContainer">
				<h3>Sprint 1</h3>

				<p>We set out to discover everything we could about heart disease, wearable medical devices, and what daily life is like for those living with a heart condition.  We conducted industry research, medical research, and interviews with SMEâ€™s as well as potential users.</p>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/pulseband/process2.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/pulseband/process3.jpg"/>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Our research and interviews changed the scope and focus of the project. We  originally were focusing on helping people manage their heart disease. We found that there was a need for a product that would help prevent heart disease or significantly delay it.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/pulseband/process4.jpg"/>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>We created user personas for the two most important user groups. Those who would use the PulseBand to monitor a current heart condition and those that were at risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack.</p>

				<h3>Sprint 2</h3>

				<p>We began designing with the focus of showing users the relationship between unhealthy habits and bad heart health to encourage changes in user behavior.</p>

						<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/pulseband/sprintTwo4.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>After numerous user scenarios, user flows, and app maps we produced our first set of wireframes.</p>

				<h3>Sprint 3</h3>

				<p>Analysis and heuristic analysis gave us enough improvements to create the second iteration of wireframes.</p>

				<p>User testing revealed some big issues that had slipped through the cracks. We were not succeeding in presenting users with their data in an  understandable way. The design had a heavier cognitive load than we were intending.</p>
