<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>JMom is an online matchmaking site where Jewish parents find potential matches for their adult children. My client had recently acquired JMom and was looking to make it profitable again by reinstating the paywall. Before doing this, the client wanted us to fix the onboarding process which he felt was too long.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>My partner and I began with competitive research, cultural research, and a heuristic analysis of the current site.</p>

<p>Our research showed that the original problem wasn’t the real issue. The client assumed that the high drop-off rate was due to too many steps in the sign up process. What we found is that rather, it was the types of questions being asked, coupled with a confusing interface that was causing user abandonment. These defects in the onboarding process were also creating problems with viewing and editing profiles later on for the user.</p>

<p>We also ran users tests and analyzed the site’s Google Analytics, which pointed out other usability issues as well. As a result we decided to revamp not only the onboarding, but the way users created, edited, and viewed profiles as well.</p>


<h2>Design Principles</h2>

<p>All design principles should help the user accomplish their goal of matching up their children with potential partners.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don’t lose your identity. This is a site for moms, not for their kids.</li>
	<li>This is a tool to use, not a chore to do. Nothing should feel unnecessary.</li>
	<li>This is a buffet. The more people we can keep using the site, the higher the success rate will be overall for the users.</li>
	<li>Having less current users means there will be less new user signing up.</li>
	<li>KISS (keep it simple silly)</li>
	<li>Users need a clear path to follow. Data should be easy to access and quick to digest.</li>
</li>

<p>We wanted the site to serve one purpose and to clearly accomplish it with every user interaction. Design principles were decided upon and were used to measure the site’s success in every area.</p>

<p>6 key areas were identified to make a complete profile. Only the most basic and critical were kept in the onboarding process. The rest were added to a ‘complete profile’ process. This way users can quickly onboard and explore the site.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p>The original onboarding process included asking a lot of broad questions about the user’s child. The blank form fields were intimidating and created a fear of not saying the “right thing”.</p>

<p>After:</p>

<p>The new personality section relies more on recognition rather than recall. It also creates similar characteristics that can be later used to sort matches. Users are able to add extra information and even write short paragraphs if they feel that the defaults don’t do their child justice.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p>After completing the profile, it was not apparent what the user’s next steps should be.</p>

<p>We created a clear call to action for users to guide them through the next steps.</p>
