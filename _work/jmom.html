		<h2>Goals</h2>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>JMom is an online matchmaking site where Jewish parents find potential matches for their adult children. My client had recently acquired JMom and was looking to make it profitable again by reinstating the paywall. Before doing this, the client wanted us to fix the onboarding process which he felt was too long.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>

			<img class="floatRight" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/jMom/process2.jpg"/>

			<p>My partner and I began with competitive research, cultural research, and a heuristic analysis of the current site.</p>

			<p>Our research showed that the original problem wasn’t the real issue. The client assumed that the high drop-off rate was due to too many steps in the sign up process. What we found is that rather, it was the types of questions being asked, coupled with a confusing interface that was causing user abandonment. These defects in the onboarding process were also creating problems with viewing and editing profiles later on for the user.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/jMom/process3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>We also ran users tests and analyzed the site’s Google Analytics, which pointed out other usability issues as well. As a result we decided to revamp not only the onboarding, but the way users created, edited, and viewed profiles as well.</p>

		<div class="container greyContainer">
			<h3>Synthesis</h3>

			<p>We wanted the site to serve one purpose and to clearly accomplish it with every user interaction. Design principles were decided upon and were used to measure the site’s success in every area.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/jMom/designPrinciples.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/jMom/process5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>6 key areas were identified to make a complete profile. Only the most basic and critical were kept in the onboarding process. The rest were added to a ‘complete profile’ process. This way users can quickly onboard and explore the site.</p>
