	<h1>Client</h1>
		<p>DeskLogic</p>

	<h2>Role</h2>
		<p>UI and UxD</p>

	<h2>Deliverables</h2>
		<p>Mood boards, style tiles, full site mockup, site style guide<p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>I was tasked with creating the UI and IxD for the Desktop App for Desk Logic, an an e-commerce platform that connects office furniture buyers directly with the furniture dealers. As the new kid on the block, the client wanted a site that would impart a sense of trustworthiness that would help users feel comfortable using this new service.</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>

	<h3>On Site Competitive Analysis</h3>

	<p>It was great working on a team for this project, we collaborated on the research and then were able to bounce ideas off of each other.</p>

	<p>Our team of three did our research together but then separately explored different visual directions. We started with competitive analysis (online and in the physical storefront) getting a feel for the furniture industry.</p>

	<h3>Online Competitive Analysis<h3>

	<p>We also explored online sites from different industries, focusing on companies that excelled in guided shopping, e-commerce, and providing a great brand experience.</p>

	<p>Some of these companies included West Elm, Knoll, Herman Millar, Ikea, Target, and True Car.</p>

	<h3>Style Exploration<h3>

	<p>After Completing the initial research I created 3 mood boards based from what I had seen in my research.</p>

	<h3>Preliminary mockups</h3>

	Option 1

	<p>The use of icons didn't seem to fit the brand of the company but I wasn’t ready to rule them out entirely. I used square placeholders instead.</p>

	Option 2

	<p>The client couldn’t decide between style tile 1 and 3 and asked me to combine them in the preliminary mockups.</p>-+

	<h3>Interaction Design Choices</h3>

	<p>Some of the interactions that I fixed were:</p>
		<ol>
		 <li>Better communicate sites value to potential users.
		    <p>The original design was not clearly communicating what the web app did and why it would benefit users. To help prevent unnecessary drop off I tried different iterations to figure out the best way to quickly  and succinctly explain the function of the web app.</p>
		 </li>
		 <li>Prevented user errors
			<p>I noticed there was an overlooked problem in the navigation. Previously, users would have been able to accidentally exit out of the ordering process, for example skipping the vision step entirely.  Since each step uses information from the previous step, it would have prevented the app from working properly causing frustration for the users.</p>
		 </li>	
	    </ol>

	I made some changes that should make it easier for the user to personalize the recommended furniture and therefore get them to check out quicker. I also made the shopping list more accessible in order to help users feel confident that they haven’t forgotten anything.

	The UI was not done for the programming section because the client hadn’t decided if it would be part of Desk Logic or it’s sister site, Plan the Space. I created a UI guide if it was kept on the Desk Logic site.
