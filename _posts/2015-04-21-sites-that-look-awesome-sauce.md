title: "Sites that look awesome-sauce"

Part of my learning has involved looking at great design and trying to understand what makes it great. I'm familiar with this approach. Although come to think of it, I'm not sure if all those hours of looking at slides of Titian and Michelangelo really made me a better painter. But I digress...

So without further ado, three sites that I find to be inspiring:

## [Rally Interactive](http://rallyinteractive.com/)

I enjoy the playful animations and the clean geometric forms. I liked their previous site as well- its hero area had some pretty rad parallax effects. I have noticed that it takes the images a bit to load. I'm assuming that's the tradeoff for having so much animation on a site.  Overall I find it refreshing when compared to the many other business portfolios I've seen

## [Turbo Tax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/)

Bear with me for a moment. There is nothing visually stunning on this site. Its ordinary. Maybe even predictable. BUT, oh the user experience! It somehow manages to take something dreaded and make it not bearable, even likable at times. It does everything possible to make your task easy and stress free. That had to involve a ton of UX design.

## [Summer Melt Down Fest](http://summermeltdownfest.com/)

Maybe it's just the graphic quality that endears it to me, I do love the illustrated look. However, it is very well organized and easy to use. Good use of color, space, and organization.
