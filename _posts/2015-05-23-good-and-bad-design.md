title: Good and Bad Design

For an assignment I needed to analyze good and bad designs from similar categories.

## Political Sites

### Bad Political Design

First up is a really poorly designed political site from the United Kingdom. 

The first thing I notice is that the text  and images are fuzzy and pixelated. This  looks unprofessional and is distracting. Even the logo is pixilated. 

Another thing I notice is that it is not easily navigable or intuitive to use. The entire home page is dominated by an image that turns out to be a link ( which was not obvious to me). The navigation should be bigger so that it is more noticeable.
 
The visual hierarchy could be improved as well. They have included ‘legal speak’ inside their header. In fact it is larger than their navigation. They are wasting space on non-essential information.  As a user of the site I wouldn’t be super interested in the legal info. Even if I was, I would expect it to be in a footer at the bottom.  Almost all sites hierarchies place legal information and other extraneous details at the bottom. 

I mentioned earlier that the site is not intuitive. Not only is it not obvious that the whole landing page is a link, but you aren’t sure where it is going to take you. There is no explanation of what will happen when you click it, or even an indication that they want you to click it.
It opens up a pdf of the parties entire platform (manifesto). It would be better to allow the user to have a preview of what the content is. Better yet, it would be more convenient to have multiple links that take me to a specific part of the manifesto I am interested in. Instead, I’m forced to wade through it on my own.

### Good Political Design

In contrast lets look at both the American Democratic and Republican websites:

Both the  Republican and Democratic sites are well laid out, easy to interpret and navigate. 

#### The Republican Site

The menu is large and clearly labeled. They anticipated that not everyone would understand the ‘hamburger’ menu icon so they labeled it. They also anticipated that users would be looking for different information so they have ‘jump to____” buttons at the top. Plus their platform has been broken into manageable chunks that make it both easy to quickly find what you are looking for and give an overview of the whole platform.

#### The Democratic Site

The menu is not large but it is hi contrast and in an expected place. The landing page is more interactive with a call to action and current tweets.

## News Site

### Bad News Design

My second  bad example was found on ‘crappy design’ subreddit and appears to be a local news website. 
The site has the article split onto multiple pages which is disruptive. It makes the reading experience longer and it prevents quick scanning of the content. The worst part of the design however, is the button used to redirect to the next page. Not only is it large, it’s one of the few things on the page with color.  This is a distraction for users trying to focus on the content being read.

### Good News Site

In contrast, cnn.com is very well designed.  There are no distracting elements on the page, except for one or two adds on the right side. Those aren’t really distracting since they are nestled among links to other news articles and videos. There is no distracting button on their site, they use continuos scrolling that allows for uninterrupted reading.

## Poster Designs

Lastly, let’s look at good vs bad paster designs.

### Bad Poster Design

Both posters display the phrase “Where there is a will, there is a way”.
The first example at first looks hip and modern, that is until you try to read it.  It took me several seconds and way too much brain power to work out what it was supposed to say. Design should never obscure a message or make a user waste brain power.
It’s composition is interesting and bold but the word’s are placed in such a way that its very difficult to read. Your brain knows that the words are supposed to be part of a whole even though different colors and text orientations are used. However, the words are too disjointed. There is no clear indecation of where we are supposed to begin reading. Is it ‘theres’ or ‘where’. They are both the same size and located at the top. It would have been helpful to make the first word larger so the visual hierachey  was clear.

### Good Poster Design

The second example is much better. It might not look as ‘cool’ but its instantly understandable and clear. 
Visual heirachy was used very effectively. I know instinctively where to begin reading, there is no guessing. Like the example before it, this poster uses contrasting font sizes for visual interest. The difference in this case is that it was used appropriately. The smaller text is not as important and is repetitive. The larger text allows readers to get the gist of the message at a glance.

To me these examples highlight a struggle in design. As designers we often are tasked with updating a design to be ‘fresh’ and ‘modern’. We want our design to be more innovative and fresh. However, sometimes we take it too far and sacrifice the content. It is far better to be clear and unambiguous in design than to be different and flashy.
