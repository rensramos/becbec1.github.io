title: Getting Started With Design
---

I've been wanting to get started with web design for a while now. I've always been interested in visual design, having a degree in fine art, but it was never anything serious. However, in the last year I have found myself being drawn to digital design.

The problem is, I was approaching it like I approach swimming pools. I like to dip my toes in first and keep them there...for a while. If I don't jump in first thing then who knows how long it will take to get in.

I needed something to push me in. Get me started. So I applied and was accepted to Designation Full Stack Design Program. It's a 16 week design boot camp based in Chicago. I'll spend 6 weeks learning online and then move to Chicago for 3 months to finish the program.

It looks intense, challenging, and inspiring. I'm looking forward to with equal parts excitement and trepidation.
