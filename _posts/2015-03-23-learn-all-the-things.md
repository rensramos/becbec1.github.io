### This is how I feel lately:

There is so much I don't know. Every day confirms the idea that in the design world, I've been living under a rock. Every new concept, tool, or process leads to others which leads to others, which....you get my point. There are endless rabbit holes that could take years to sort through, and I only have months.

I thought I would know much more than I do, having been an art major. I mean, how have I not learned illustrator or photoshop yet?!!!  I guess I've always been less intimidated with physical tools than digital ones. Hopefully it won't take long to change that.
